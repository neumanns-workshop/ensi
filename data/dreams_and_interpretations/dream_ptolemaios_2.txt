Ptolemaios to Damoxenos (From no. 78)

Ptolemaios to Damoxenos, greeting!

"On the 14th I thought that I was in Alexandria on a great tower. I had a beautiful face, and I did not want to show my face to anyone because it was beautiful. An old woman sat beside me, and there was a crowd from north of me and from the east. They cried out that a man has been made into charcoal in many... (text fragmentary) and he says to me: 'Wait a bit, and I will bring thee to the divine spirit (daimon) Knephis in order that thou mayest worship him.'

"And I thought that I was saying to an elder: 'Father, dost thou not see this vision which I have beheld?' I related (it) to him. He gave me two reeds. Looking quickly I saw Knephis. Rejoice all ye who are with me. Release soon comes to me."
