A Dream of The King (KUB XV 5 III: 4-14)

"A dream of His Majesty: When the lady Danu-Hepa said again and again to His Majesty (in a dream as follows): 'When the Weather-god comes to heaven, he should not find you to be stingy(?)!' The king said: 'I have already before made a golden zahum-ewer for the Weather-god!' The lady Danu-Hepa said: 'It is not good (enough)!' and the king of Hakmish (i.e., Hattushili) said (in the dream to His Majesty): 'Why did you not give the huhupal-instruments and the lapis lazuli stones which you have promised to him, to the Weather-god?' Said the (priestess) Ijepa-SUM: 'One must give the huhupal-instruments and the lapis lazuli stones to the great deity.'"
