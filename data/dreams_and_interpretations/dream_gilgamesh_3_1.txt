Three Dreams of Gilgamesh (KUB IV 48:6-19): Dream 1

Sleep, which at night is poured (over man), caught them. But in the middle of the night, the sleep departed from him.

The dream he told to Enkidu:

"Dear friend, if you did not wake me, why am I awake? Enkidu, my friend, I must have had (literally: seen) a dream! Did you wake me? Why? Aside from my first dream, I had a second dream:

In my dream, dear friend, the mountain collapsed (?). It threw me over, seized my feet. The sheen became stronger, a man of extraordinary beauty, whose splendor exceeded any in the country, appeared. From under the mountain, he pulled me out and gave me water to drink. My heart became quiet, and he set my feet (again) on the ground."
