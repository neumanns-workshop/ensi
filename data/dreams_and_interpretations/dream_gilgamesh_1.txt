Dreams of Gilgamesh (Old Babylonian version, PBS X/3 I; 1-II: 1)

Gilgamesh rose from his bed to report the dream. He said to his mother:

"Mother, in the middle of the night, I proudly walked up and down among the people. There were stars in the sky, but suddenly a meteorite of Anu, the Sky-god, fell upon me! I tried to lift it, but it was too heavy for me. I shook it, but I could not move it. All of Uruk assembled around it, and the people kissed its feet. I resisted them, but they were too many against me. Then I lifted it and carried it off to you!"

The mother of Gilgamesh, who knows everything, said to him:

"Surely, Gilgamesh, someone as strong as you has been born in the open countryside, and the hills have raised him! When you see him, you will rejoice, and the people will kiss his feet. You will embrace him, and you will bring him to me!"

He lay down again and saw a second dream. He told his mother:

"Mother, I had a second dream. In the street of Uruk, there was a strange axe lying on the ground, and the people of Uruk gathered around it. The form of the axe was strange, but as soon as I saw it, I rejoiced, and I loved it like a wife. I embraced it, then took it and placed it at my side!"

The mother of Gilgamesh, who knows everything, said to him:

"My son, this dream also means that a great companion is coming to you. You will love him like a wife, and he will stand by your side. He will be your equal, and together, you will achieve great things."
