A Warning Dream (Ashurbanipal, V R 2, III: 118-127)

In those days, a man went to bed in the middle of the night and had a dream as follows:

Upon the pedestal (kigallu) of the image of Sin was an inscription. The variant adds that the god Nabu, the scribe of the world, was standing there, reading again and again the inscription on the pedestal of Sin:

"Upon those who plot evil against Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, and resort to actual hostilities, I shall bestow a miserable death. I shall put an end to their lives through the swift iron dagger of war, conflagration, hunger, and pestilenceâ€”the disease of Irra!"

This dream I, Ashurbanipal, heard, and I put my trust in the word of my lord Sin.
