Dream of Sethos (Herodotus 2:139)

Afterwards, when Sennacherib, king of the Arabians and the Assyrians, marched his vast army into Egypt, the warriors one and all refused to come to Sethos' aid. Distressed by this, the monarch entered into the inner sanctuary and, before the image of the god, bewailed the fate which impended over him.

As he wept, he fell asleep and dreamed that the god came and stood at his side, bidding him to be of good cheer and go boldly forth to meet the Arabian host, which would do him no harm, as the god himself would send help.

Sethos, relying on the dream, gathered those Egyptians who were willing to follow him. These were not warriors but traders, artisans, and market people. With this untrained force, Sethos marched to Pelusium, which commands the entrance to Egypt, and there pitched his camp.
