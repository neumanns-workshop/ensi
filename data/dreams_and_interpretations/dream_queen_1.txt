A Dream of The Queen (KUB XV 1 I: 1-11)

"A dream of the queen: ... the queen has made a vow in her dream to the goddess Hebat of the town Uda as follows: 'If you, goddess, my lady, will have made well again His Majesty and not have him given over to the "Evil," I shall make a statue of gold for Hebat and I shall make her a rosette of gold. They shall call it 'Rosette of Hebat.' And I shall make a pectorale of gold for your breast. They shall call it 'Pectorale of the goddess.'"
