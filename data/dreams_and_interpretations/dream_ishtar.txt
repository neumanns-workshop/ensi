Dream of the Priest of Ishtar (Ashurbanipal, H. Winckler, Sammlung von Keilschrifttexten, K. 3040: rev. 10 ff., Leipzig, Pfeiffer, 1895)

Ishtar heard my desperate sighs and said to me in a theophany: "Be not afraid that you see me!" This alone put confidence in my heart. She continued: "I have already had mercy upon you on account of the prayer you performed and because your eyes were full of tears."

Indeed, in the midst of the very same night in which I addressed myself to Ishtar, a sabru-priest went to bed and had a dream. He woke up with a start, and Ishtar made him see a nocturnal vision. He reported it to me as follows:

"The goddess Ishtar, who dwells in Arbela, entered the room, quivers hanging at her right and left, holding the bow in her hand, the sharp sword drawn and ready for battle. She stood before you, speaking to you like a real mother.

Then Ishtar, the most high among the gods, called you to give you the following order: 'Wait with the attack because wherever you intend to go, I myself shall set out for!' Then you said to her, 'Wherever you go, I will go with you, Supreme Lady!'

But she repeated her command: 'You stay here, the place where you should be; eat, drink wine, make merry, pay homage to my godhead while I shall go and accomplish this task and make you obtain your heart's desires! Then your face will not be pale, your feet will not shake anymore, and you need not wipe off your cold sweat even in the thick of the battle!'

Thereupon, she wrapped you in her sweet-smelling baby-sling, protecting your entire body. Then her countenance shone like fire, and she went out of the room in rage to defeat your enemies, proceeding in the direction of Teumman, king of Elam, who had made her very angry."
