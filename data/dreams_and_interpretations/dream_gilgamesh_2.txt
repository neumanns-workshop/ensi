Dreams of Gilgamesh (Neo-Assyrian version, Thompson Epic, pl. 6-8 V: 25-VI: 27)

Gilgamesh arose to report his dreams and said to his mother:

"Dear mother, in the dream I had this night, there were stars in the sky, but eventually something like the kisru of Anu fell upon me. I tried to lift it, but it was stronger than I. I turned it over, but I could not even shake it. All of Uruk was assembled around it, and all the land was gathered. The people were in throngs around it."

Ninsun, the wise, she who knows everything, said to Gilgamesh:

"The axe that you have seen is a human being, and that you embraced it like a wife means that I shall rank this person as equal to you. A strong one, a companion, one who will save a friend. His strength will be as mighty as that of the kisru of Anu!"

Gilgamesh opened his mouth and said to his mother:

"May he arrive, may I acquire a friend."
