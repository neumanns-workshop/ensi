First Dream-Appearance of Ishtar (MVAeG 29(3): 6 ff. ?3)

"And while I was still a child, I was (only) a groom (literally: a 'He-with-the-donkey-halter'). My Lady Ishtar sent my brother Muwatalli to my father Murshili in a dream (with the message): 'There are only few (literally: short) years (to live) for Hattushili; he is not one to live (long); give him to me, he shall be my priest! Then he (shall stay) alive.' Then my father took me, a (mere) child, and gave me to the goddess for (her) service."
