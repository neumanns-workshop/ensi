Dream of Gyges (ASSurbanipal, V R 1 ff. II: 95-104)

Assur, the god who created me, let Gyges, king of Lydia, a region beyond the sea, a distant country the name of which my royal predecessors had not even heard, see in a dream the "pronunciation" (nibittu) of my name. The god said: "Lay hold of the feet of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, and you will conquer your enemies through the mere mention of his name!"

The very day he had this dream, Gyges sent his mounted messenger to inquire after the state of my health. Through his messenger, he reported his dream to me. From the day he laid hold of my royal feet, he conquered the Cimmerians who had been harassing the inhabitants of his country.
