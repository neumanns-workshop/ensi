Dream of Ptolemy Soter (Plutarch, De Iside 28; also Tacitus, Historiae 4:83)

Ptolemy Soter saw in a dream the colossus of the god Pluto in Sinope. However, because he had not seen it before, he did not understand the meaning of its form. In the dream, the colossus gave him orders to bring it as quickly as possible to Alexandria. Not knowing what the colossus meant or where it was located, Ptolemy shared his vision with his friends.

A well-traveled man named Sosibios came forward and said that he had seen such a colossus in Sinope. Ptolemy then sent Soteles and Dionysios there, who, after a long time and with great difficulty—and not without divine providence—stole the statue and brought it back to Alexandria.

When the colossus was inspected, the scholars around Timothy the exegete and Manetho of Sebennytos identified it as an image of Pluto. They based their conclusion on the evidence of the Cerberus and the serpent depicted on the statue. These scholars persuaded Ptolemy that the image was of no other god but Serapis.
