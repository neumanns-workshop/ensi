Dream of Hattushili (op. cit. ?4)

"My brother Muwatalli named me for (an ordeal by means of) the sacred wheel. My Lady Ishtar, however, appeared to me in a dream and said to me in the dream as follows: 'Shall I abandon you to a (hostile) deity? Be not afraid!' And with (the help of) the goddess I was acquitted. Because the goddess, my Lady, held me by the hand, she never abandoned me to a hostile deity (or) an evil judgment."
