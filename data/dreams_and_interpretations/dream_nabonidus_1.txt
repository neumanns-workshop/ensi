Dream of Nabonidus (V R 64 1: 13-55)

During my lawful rule, the great Lords became reconciled with this town and its temple out of love for my kingship. They had mercy upon the town and let me see a dream in the very first year of my everlasting rule:

Marduk, the Great Lord, and Sin, the luminary of heaven and earth, stood there together. Marduk said to me: "Nabonidus, king of Babylon, bring bricks on your own chariot, drawn by your own horse. Rebuild the temple Ehulhul, and let Sin, the Great Lord, take up his dwelling there!"

I said to Marduk, Ellil of the gods: "The Umman-manda (the Medes) are laying siege to the very temple which you have ordered me to rebuild, and their armed might is very great!"

But Marduk said to me: "The Umman-manda of whom you spoke, they, their country, and all the kings, their allies, shall cease to exist!"

And indeed, when the third year came to pass, Marduk made Cyrus, king of Anshan, his young servant, rise against them. Cyrus scattered the numerous Umman-manda with his small army and captured Astyages, king of the Umman-manda, bringing him in fetters into his land. That was the doing of the Great Lord Marduk, whose command cannot be changed.
