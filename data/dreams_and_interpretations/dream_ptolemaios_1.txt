Ptolemaios' Dream on the 15th of Pachon (June 14, 161 B.C.)

"I thought that in my dream I was calling upon the most great Amon to come from north of me, being the third until he arrives. I thought that (I saw) a cow in that place and that she was in birth travail. He seizes the cow and puts her down (or: covers her over). He inserts his hand into her vulva and draws out a bull. What I saw in the dream, may it be well for me!"
