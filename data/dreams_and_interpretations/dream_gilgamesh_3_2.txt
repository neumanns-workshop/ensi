Three Dreams of Gilgamesh (KUB IV 48:6-19): Dream 2

"The second dream which I saw: In the midst of the mountain, we were (caught). The mountain collapsed, and we, like 'reed-flies,' were trapped."

Enkidu, who was born in the open country, said to his friend:

"Dear friend, your dream is favorable! The dream is precious indeed. The mountain which you have seen is Humbaba, it means we shall seize Humbaba and kill him. We shall throw his corpse into the plain. Towards the West they will dig a pit."
