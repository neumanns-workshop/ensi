Three Dreams of Gilgamesh (KUB IV 48:6-19): Dream 3

Then Gilgamesh went up and upon the mountain and offered his meal-offering:

"Mountain, bring me a dream. Make it for me!"

The mountain brought a dream. A cool draft passed by, a zephyr (?) blew. It made him fall asleep. [Gil]gamesh planted his chin on his knees, and sleep which (at this time of the day) is (everywhere) poured upon man overcame him.

At the midnight-watch, his sleep ended (suddenly). He rose and said to his friend:

"Dear friend, you did not call me (or did you?), then why am I awake? You did not touch me, then why am I perturbed? A god did not pass by, then why are my limbs paralyzed? Dear friend, I had a third dream, and the dream I had was confounding in every respect:

Heaven roared, the earth tumbled, daylight subsided, and darkness came forth. Lightning flashed, fire shot up. The clouds (?) became dense, and it rained death. Then came to an end the glowing (?), the fire came to an end, and what had fallen turned to ashes. Come, let us go down (from the mountain), we can (better) deliberate in the plain!"
