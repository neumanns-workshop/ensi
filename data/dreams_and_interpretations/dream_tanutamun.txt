Dream of Tanutamun (Stela publ. by Maspero, Rev. arch6ol. XVII 329 ff.)

Year 1 of his installation as king... His majesty saw a dream in the night: two serpents, one on his right, the other on his left. His majesty awoke, but he did not find them. His majesty said:

"Why has this happened to me?"

Then they declared to him:

"Upper Egypt belongs to you; take for yourself Lower Egypt (also). The Two Goddesses have appeared on your head. The land is given to you in its length and in its breadth. There is no other to share it with you!"

When his majesty appeared on the throne of Horus in this year, his majesty came forth from the place in which he had been, as Horus came forth from Chemmis. When he came forth, a million came to him and a hundred thousand followed after him. Then his majesty said:

"True indeed is the dream; it is beneficial to him who places it in his heart but evil for him who does not know it."
