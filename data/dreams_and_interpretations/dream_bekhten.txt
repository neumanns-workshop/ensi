Dream of the Prince of Bekhten (Bentresh Stela, lines 24-25)

Then the prince of Bekhten was asleep on his bed and he saw this god, he having come to him out of his chapel—he was a falcon of gold—and he flew up to the sky to Egypt. He awoke in terror (?). Then he said to the priest of Khonsu the Plan-maker in Thebes:

"This god, he is here with us (but) he (would) go to Egypt. Let his chariot go to Egypt!"

Then the prince of Bekhten caused this god to proceed to Egypt.
