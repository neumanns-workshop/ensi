Dreams from a Religious Poem (Ludlul bel nemeqi, KAR 175: 8-44)

(In a) dream as well as in a vision at dawn it was shown to me. A man, surpassing in size, of glorious form, beautifully clad, appeared. In the morning dream, something went forth against me, and my flesh became numb. The apparition said: "The Lady has sent me."

I said something in response, but it is unclear. He answered as follows: "She has sent me."

After two damaged lines:

Again, I went to bed and saw a dream. In the dream which I saw, a man appeared. He held a tamarisk branch, used for purification, in his hand and said: "Tib-utul-Ellil, who lives in Nippur, has sent me to purify you!" He poured water over me, recited the incantation restoring life, and anointed me.

A third time, I had a dream. In the dream which I had that very same night, a figure like a human being with beautiful features appeared. A queen entered, like a deity, accompanied by a maiden. The uttering of the ahulap, a ritual expression of divine pardon, was for me. "Be not afraid!" she said.

She uttered the ahulap for me, the greatly afflicted (or the utterly exhausted).

Someone else had a vision concerning me in the midst of the night:

In that dream, Ur-Nintinugga appeared. A bearded man, wearing his crown, stood there. It was the masmasu-priest, saying: "Marduk has sent me!" He brought something to Subsi-mesre-Nergal. In his pure hands, he carried it. To my attendant, he entrusted it.
