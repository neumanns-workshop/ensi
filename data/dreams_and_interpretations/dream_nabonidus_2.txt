Another Dream of Nabonidus (MVAG 1(1) pl. 76, VI: 1-36)

With regard to the conjunction of the Great Star and the moon, I became apprehensive, but in a dream, a man stood suddenly beside me and said: "There are no evil portents involved in the conjunction!"

In the same dream, Nebuchadnezzar, my royal predecessor, appeared to me, standing on a chariot with one attendant. The attendant said to Nebuchadnezzar: "Do speak to Nabonidus so that he can report to you the dream he has had!" Nebuchadnezzar was agreeable and said to me: "Tell me what good signs you have seen!"

I answered him, saying: "In my dream, I saw with joy the Great Star, the moon, and the planet Jupiter (Marduk) high up in the sky, and the Great Star called me by my name."
