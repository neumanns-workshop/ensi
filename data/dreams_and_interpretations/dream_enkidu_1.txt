Dream of Enkidu (Hittite, KUB VIII 48 I: 2-22, and duplicates, cf. Friedrich, ZA 39: 17 ff.)

Enkidu answered Gilgamesh:

"I shall tell you the dream I had this night:

Anu, Enlil, Ea, and the Sun-god of Heaven were in council. Anu said to Enlil, 'Why did they kill the Bull of Heaven and also kill Huwawa, who watched the mountains from a cedar tree?' Anu then asked, 'Who shall die among them?' Enlil replied, 'Enkidu shall die, but Gilgamesh shall not die!'

Then the Sun-god of Heaven answered Enlil, the hero: 'Was it not at your own command that they killed the Bull of Heaven and Huwawa? Now the innocent Enkidu shall die?' Enlil turned in anger to the Sun-god of Heaven: 'Why did you—as if you were their comrade—daily go with them?'

Enkidu was lying down ill in front of Gilgamesh, with his tears streaming like canals. Enkidu said:

'Brother, you are my dear brother! Yet they are placing me above my brother! Now I shall be with the dead, shall sit at the threshold of the dead, and shall not see my dear brother with my eyes any more!'
