A Dream of The Queen (KUB XV 1 III: 8-16)

"When the god Gurwashu said to the queen in a dream (as follows): 'As to that matter which is on your heart concerning your husband (I promise): He will live, I shall give him 100 years!' The queen made a vow in (her) dream as follows: 'If you do thus for me and my husband remains alive, I shall give to the deity three harsialli-containers, one with oil, one with honey, and one with fruits.'"
