The Crossing of the River Idid'e (Ashurbanipal, V R 3, V: 95-104)

The army saw the river Idid'e, which at that moment was a raging torrent, and was afraid of the crossing. But the goddess Ishtar, who dwells in Arbela, let my army have a dream in the midst of the night, addressing them as follows: "I shall go in front of Ashurbanipal, the king whom I have created myself!"

The army relied upon this dream and crossed the river Idid'e safely.
