Second Dream-Appearance of Ishtar (op. cit. ?12)

"Now, while my Lady Ishtar had even before this been promising me the kingship, at that time, my Lady Ishtar appeared to my wife in a dream (saying): 'I shall assist your husband, and all Hattusha will be turned to the side of your husband. (Ever) since I brought him up, I did not, at any time, abandon him to an evil judgment (or) a hostile deity. Now, I will exalt him and make him the priest of the Sun-goddess of the town Arinna. And you too, make me your parassi (patron-deity?)!' And my Lady Ishtar stood behind me, and whatever she promised me occurred."
