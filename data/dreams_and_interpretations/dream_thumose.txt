Dream of Thutmose IV (Sphinx Stela, lines 8-12)

One of these days it happened that the King's-Son Thutmose came driving at the time of the midday and he rested in the shadow of this great god (i.e., the Sphinx). Slumber and sleep overcame him at the moment when the sun was at the zenith, and he found the majesty of this august god speaking with his own mouth as a father speaks to his son, as follows:

"Behold me, look upon me, my son Thutmose. I am your father Harmakhis-Khepri-Re-Atum. I will give to you my kingly office on earth as foremost of the living, and you shall wear the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt on the throne of Geb, the Hereditary Prince. To you shall belong the earth in its length and its breadth and all that which the eye of the All-Lord illuminates. You shall possess provisions from within the Two Lands as well as the great products of every foreign country.

For the extent of a long period of years my face has been turned to you and my heart devoted to you. You belong to me. Behold, my state is like that of one who is in suffering, and all my members are out of joint, for the sand of the desert, this place on which I am, presses upon me. I have waited to have you do what is in my heart, for I know that you are my son and my champion. Approach! Behold, I am with you. I am your guide."

He completed this speech. And this King's-Son awoke when he heard this ... he recognized the words of this god.
