The Second Dream: (text fragmentary)

The Third Dream:
*"I saw Ptolemaios holding a sword in his hand and going through the street. He knocks on the door, and it is opened. He came to blows (?) wishing to strike him. I say: 'By no means do this, or thou wilt destroy thy slave. A master does not destroy his own slave!'"

The Fourth Dream:
*"A woman sits on a mat, holding a child on the mat and another (woman or child?) opposite her on another mat. I say to her: 'Thy mat grows herbs and cabbage.' She was sitting and not moving."

The Third Dream:

The Fourth Dream:
"I thought that (I saw) two women sitting with a man. They play with him and swear thus: 'By holy Isis!'"
