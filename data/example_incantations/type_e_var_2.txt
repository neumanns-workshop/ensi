Type E Additional Variant (KAR 252 II: 6-18)

Conjuration:"As I shall throw you, lump, into water and you will disintegrate and dissolve, may the evil of this dream crumble, disintegrate, and dissolve! May it never return to its place!May it cross the river, scale the mountains! May my evil be dissolved; like smoke, may it rise skyward!Like this torn-off twig of the tamarisk, may it not return to its place!Tamarisk, purify me! Mastakal-plant, absolve me!Heart of the date-palm, make me holy!May the river receive me and carry off my misfortune!Oh Utu, the dream I had shall be good; Oh Utu, the dream I had shall be trustworthy! Oh Utu, change the dream I had into a good one!"

Ritual: He shall recite this conjuration three times over either a lump of salt or a lump of clay, throw it into water, and the evil consequences of the dream will not affect him.
