Type A (KAR 252 I: 7-12)
If a man has a wrong dream, he must, to prevent its evil consequences, say to himself before setting his foot upon the floor in the morning: "The dream I have had is good, good, verily good before Nanna and Utu!" Thus he shall say. In this way, he creates a good egirru for himself, and the evil of his dream will not come near him.
