Conjuration: "My dream was pleasant, my egirru good, good before Nanna and Utu, good before Nanna and Utu, good before Nanna and Utu!Upon the command of queen Ninlil, without whom no decision concerning the country is made, I have made a good (omen)—may it be for the good!I have set my foot on the floor—may it be for the good!All day may they be good for me, all month may they be good for me, all year may they be good for me!May they remove what spell has been pronounced against me, may they remove what hate has done to me, may they give back to me what was taken away, may they put into my hands again what I lost unknowingly!I belong to the heroic Marduk, son of Ea: when misfortune sees me, may it hide itself, may I not fall from misfortune into more misfortune!"

In Sumerian: "Marduk, first-born son of the Abyss! It is for you to make things good and pleasant. Be conjured in the name of heaven, be conjured in the name of the netherworld!"

Ritual: If a man cannot remember his dream, he shall wash his hands with soap in bed before setting his foot on the floor. Then he shall recite the conjuration three times, and he will be lucky.(Variant ritual: He shall set his left foot on the right side of his bed, recite the conjuration three times, and rise.)
