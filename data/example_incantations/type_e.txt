Conjuration:"Lump! In your substance my substance has been fused, in my substance your substance has been fused!As I throw you into water and you crumble, disintegrate, and dissolve, may the evil consequences of all the dreams I have had be gone, melted away, and sixty double-miles removed from my body!"

Ritual: He shall smear the lump over his entire body, tell the lump all the dreams he has had, and then throw it into water. The evil will pass him by.
