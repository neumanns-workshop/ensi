Conjuration:"Oh Utu, when you rise from the Cedar-Mountain, all the gods greet you with jubilations, all mankind rejoices over you.The barui-priest brings you cedar perfume, the widow brings flour, the poor woman brings oil, the rich man brings a lamb. But I bring you a lump (of clay), the product of the netherworld.Oh lump, product of the netherworld, in my substance has been fused your substance, in your substance has been fused my substance.As I throw you into water and you crumble, disintegrate, and dissolve, may the evil of the dream I had crumble, disintegrate, and dissolve! May it fall away, as you do!"

Title: A prayer for one who has had a "dark" dream.

Ritual: He shall take a lump of earth from a closed-up door, recite the conjuration over it three times, and throw it into water. His misfortune will depart.
