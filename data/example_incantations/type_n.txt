Conjuration and Ritual for Dust-Throwing Dreams: "Utu, supreme judge, you are lord of heaven and earth, lord of what is above and below, light of the Igigi and the Anunnaki, the one who makes decisions. I, so-and-so, son of so-and-so, your servant, a worshipper of your great godhead, approach you. The dust which in a dream or waking vision was thrown upon me—whether by a friend, companion, comrade, known or unknown—annihilate its evil! May this tamarisk purify me, this Dilbat-plant absolve me, and this 'white' plant give me life again!"

Ritual:

Perform the ritual Cleaning-of-the-Mouth.

Wash the effigy of the offender with water.

Offer sacrifices before Utu: lamb, eā-flour, mirsu-porridge, honey, beer, and wine.

Recite the conjuration and prostrate yourself before Utu.

Make a male and female effigy of clay, wash yourself over the effigy, and the god will accept your prayer.
