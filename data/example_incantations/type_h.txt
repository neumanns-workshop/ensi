If a man had an evil dream and is depressed, the priest shall make (or roll) seven small clay balls.

The man shall tell (pasaru) the dream seven times to the seven clay balls.

The priest shall scatter the clay balls at a crossroad.

Before Utu, the man shall say:"May the dream I had go to a place of no return."Seven times he shall say this, and he will be relieved.
