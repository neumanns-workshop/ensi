Type G (K. 8171+: x + 7-14; KAR 252 I: 19-27)

Ritual Preparation:If a man has had an evil dream during the night and is depressed, he shall take, in the early morning, before he has set his foot on the floor:

The "thorn" from the northern side of a date palm.

A new wick made of combed wool, steeped in oil.

He shall light a lamp.

Conjuration:"Gibil! Glowing, strong lord! Companion of Utu, king [ ], you are great, overpowering among the gods, your brothers! All my dreams which I do not know but you know, (which) I have seen [ ], annihilate their evil! Mighty Gibil, strong one who makes potent exorcistic rituals, consume all the evil signs."

Ritual:The dream shall be recited over the "thorn" and burned in the fire. The fire-god Gibil is addressed to consume both the dream and its evil.
