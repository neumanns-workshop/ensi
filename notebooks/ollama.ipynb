Holding me by the hand, he led me down to the Dark Mansion, the abode of Irkalla. To the house which he who enters will not leave anymore, upon a road on which there is no way back. To the house whose inhabitants are bereft of light, where earth is their fare and clay their food. Clad like birds in feather-garments, they sit in darkness, never to see light again.\\n\\nTo the House of Dust, where I entered, I beheld all the kings, their mitres put away. I saw the princes, all the crown-bearers who had ruled the land since antiquity. To these appointees of Anum and Ellil, roasted meats were served. Bake-meats were served, and cold water was poured for them from water-skins.\\n\\nIn the House of Dust where I entered, reside high-priests (enu) as well as psalmists (lagaru). Reside the purification-priests and the ecstatics, reside the priests who anoint the lavers of the great gods. There resides Etana, there resides Sumuqan. There also resides the Queen of the Netherworld, Ereshkigal. And Belit-irsitim, the scribe of the Netherworld, is kneeling in front of her, holding a tablet and reading out to her.

Performing a sacrifice, he begged the gods to reveal to him what was happening. He dreamed of a papyrus boat (called rhops in Egyptian) anchoring at Memphis. Upon it was a great throne, and on the throne sat the greatly glorious benefactress of fruits and queen of the gods, Isis, with all the gods of Egypt standing to her right and left.\\n\\nOne god came forward in their midst—a being whose height was twenty-one cubits—and spoke as follows:\\n\\n\"Come to me, goddess of gods, having the greatest power and ruling over the cosmos, and giving life to all the gods, Isis, and be gracious and hearken to me. As thou hast commanded, I have preserved the land blamelessly. And whereas King Nektonabos has taken every kind of care of me, Samaus, appointed by thee over the land, has neglected my temple and opposed my commands. I am still outside my own temple, and the things in the sanctuary are only half-finished because of the worthlessness of the one in charge!\"\\n\\n(col. III) Hearing this, Isis said nothing. When Nektonabos awoke, he gave orders to the high priest and prophet of Onuris at Sebennytos to report on the unfinished sanctuary called Pherso. They confirmed that it was complete except for the inscribing of the obliterated hieroglyphs in the stonework. Nektonabos then summoned the most talented artist, Petesis, from Aphroditopolis, to complete the work quickly.\\n\\n(col. V) Petesis accepted the commission but delayed starting the work. Walking through the southern part of the temple, he noticed the daughter of an unguent-maker, whose beauty caught his eye...
